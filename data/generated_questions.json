The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein.  Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure was 37/10/4 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure was noted to be 22 mmHg.  The pulmonary arterial pressures were noted to be 31/14/21 mmHg.  Following this, the catheter was removed, the sheath was flushed and a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter was the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery was cannulated and selective angiogram was obtained in orthogonal views.  Following this, the catheter was exchanged over the guidewire for 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter.  We were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery.  Therefore, we exchanged for a Williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views.  Following this, this catheter was exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-French Langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle was entered and left ventriculography was performed.

Sheath angiograms revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy was sealed using a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches.  There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities.  The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion.  The remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left ventricle appears to be normal sized.  The aortic valve is heavily calcified.  The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%.  There was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted.

Mitral valve posterior annuloplasty using a Cosgrove Galloway Medtronic fuser band.,3.  Posterior leaflet abscess resection.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia,TIMES:  ,Aortic cross-clamp time was ** minutes.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time total was ** minutes.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the patient's chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel was used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization was given.  Next, the chest retractor was positioned.  The pericardium was opened with Bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  We then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 Ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next, double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted.  A 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our SEC cannula.  This was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a Y-shaped circuit.  Next, a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  Through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  This was likewise connected to the Y connection of our venous cannula portion.  We then used a 4-0 U-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which was inserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the SVC and IVC, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  Sondergaard's groove was taken down.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  This was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  Next, the aorta was cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium.  The left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker.  Next, our self-retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view.  Of note was the fact that the mitral valve P2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  The borders of the P2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  After doing so, the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  Given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it was decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 Ethibond pledgeted suture.  This was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  Prior to doing so, care was taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  The pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied.  Next, the more anterior portion of the P2 segment was reconstructed by running a 4-0 Prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it.  This was done without difficulty.  The apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  There was noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  It was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  Next, 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  Care was taken to go from trigone to trigone.  Prior to placing these sutures, the annulus was sized and noted to be a *** size for the Cosgrove-Galloway suture band ring from Medtronic.  After, as mentioned, we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus, and they were passed through the CG suture band.  The suture band was lowered into position and tied in place.  We then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation.  We subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  We closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  This was done without difficulty.  We de-aired the heart.  We then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  The aortic cross-clamp was removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  We then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 Prolene.  We placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin.  The patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed.  We then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  This site was buttressed with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We placed a mediastinal #32-French chest tube as well as a right chest Blake drain.  The mediastinum was inspected for any signs of bleeding.

    "question": "What is the main purpose of performing a posterior annuloplasty with a Cosgrove-Galloway Medtronic suture band in mitral valve surgery, as described in this procedure?",
    "options": [
      "A. To excise infected tissue from the mitral valve",
      "B. To replace the entire mitral valve with a prosthetic valve",

      "D. To restore coronary artery blood flow"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Annuloplasty using a suture band, such as the Cosgrove-Galloway band, is performed to reinforce and reduce the size of the mitral valve annulus, thereby improving leaflet coaptation and reducing regurgitation. Options A and B are incorrect because excising infected tissue and replacing the valve are not the functions of annuloplasty. Option D is unrelated to mitral valve repair, as it pertains to coronary artery revascularization.",

    "transcription": "OPERATIONS,1.  Mitral valve repair using a quadrangular resection of the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet.,2.  Mitral valve posterior annuloplasty using a Cosgrove Galloway Medtronic fuser band.,3.  Posterior leaflet abscess resection.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia,TIMES:  ,Aortic cross-clamp time was ** minutes.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time total was ** minutes.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the patient's chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel was used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization was given.  Next, the chest retractor was positioned.  The pericardium was opened with Bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  We then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 Ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next, double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted.  A 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our SEC cannula.  This was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a Y-shaped circuit.  Next, a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  Through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  This was likewise connected to the Y connection of our venous cannula portion.  We then used a 4-0 U-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which was inserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the SVC and IVC, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  Sondergaard's groove was taken down.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  This was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  Next, the aorta was cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium.  The left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker.  Next, our self-retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view.  Of note was the fact that the mitral valve P2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  The borders of the P2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  After doing so, the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  Given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it was decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 Ethibond pledgeted suture.  This was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  Prior to doing so, care was taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  The pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied.  Next, the more anterior portion of the P2 segment was reconstructed by running a 4-0 Prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it.  This was done without difficulty.  The apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  There was noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  It was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  Next, 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  Care was taken to go from trigone to trigone.  Prior to placing these sutures, the annulus was sized and noted to be a *** size for the Cosgrove-Galloway suture band ring from Medtronic.  After, as mentioned, we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus, and they were passed through the CG suture band.  The suture band was lowered into position and tied in place.  We then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation.  We subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  We closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  This was done without difficulty.  We de-aired the heart.  We then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  The aortic cross-clamp was removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  We then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 Prolene.  We placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin.  The patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed.  We then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  This site was buttressed with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We placed a mediastinal #32-French chest tube as well as a right chest Blake drain.  The mediastinum was inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There were none.  We closed the sternum with #7 sternal wires in interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with a #1 Vicryl followed by a 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 3-0 Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in good condition."

Patient was placed in the thoracoabdominal position with the left chest up and the hips back to a 30-degree angle.  The left groin, abdominal and chest were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A thoracoabdominal incision was made.  The 8th interspace was entered.  The costal margin was divided.  The retroperitoneal space was entered and bluntly dissected free to the psoas, bringing all the peritoneal contents to the midline, exposing the aorta.  The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down so the aorta could be dissected free at the T10 level just above the diaphragm.  It was dissected free circumferentially.  The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries.  The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this.

This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine.  A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow.  Bypass was instituted.  The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm.  The area was divided at this point.  A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  The graft was brought into the diaphragm.  Clamps were then placed on the iliacs, and the pump was shut off.  The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation.  The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch.  The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference.  The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels.  The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established.  An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  An area of graft was removed.  The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.

General inhalational anesthesia was administered through the patient's tracheotomy tube.  The small Parsons laryngoscope was inserted and the 2.9-mm telescope was used to inspect the airway.  There was an estimated 60-70% circumferential mature subglottic stenosis that extended from just under the vocal folds to approximately 3 mm below the vocal folds.  The stoma showed some suprastomal fibroma.  The remaining tracheobronchial passages were clear.  The patient's 3.5 neonatal tracheostomy tube was repositioned and secured with Velcro ties.  Bleeding was negligible.  There were no untoward complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition."

",
    "transcription": "HISTORY:,  The patient is a 10-1/2-year-old born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava, complete atrioventricular septal defect, a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium, and double-outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels, the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis.  He had undergone staged repair beginning on 04/21/1997 with a right modified Blalock-Taussig shunt followed on 09/02/1999 with a bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt, and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation.  These procedures were performed at Medical College Hospital.  Family states that they moved to the United States.  Evaluation at the Children's Hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional Glenn shunt as well as occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  He was also found to have elevated Glenn pressures at 22 mmHg, transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmHg.  The QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  A large decompressing venous collateral was also appreciated.  The patient was brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the right-sided atrium pulmonary veins and the right ventricle.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta.  A separate port of arterial access was obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing a 5-French sheath.,Percutaneous access into the right jugular vein was attempted, but unsuccessful.  Ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein.  Using percutaneous technique and a 5-French sheath, 5-French wedge catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left caval-pulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire.  This catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein.  The catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 4-French Bernstein catheter, which was advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava.  A balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of a small right lower pulmonary artery.  There was no vascular continuity to the stump of the right Glenn.  The jugular venous catheter and sheaths were exchanged over a wire for a 6-French flexor sheath, which was advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava.  The Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced using a Terumo guidewire.  Probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery.  The angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed a diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis.  The distal pulmonary measured approximately 5.5 to 60 mm in diameter with a long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length.  The length of the obstruction was balloon dilated using ultra-thin SD 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist.  This facilitated advancement of a flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis.  A PG 2960 BPX Genesis stent premounted on a 6 mm OptiProbe.  A balloon catheter was advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with a near-complete disappearance of proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated a good stent apposition to the caval wall.  Further angioplasty was then performed utilizing an ultra-thin SDS 8 x 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmospheres pressure with complete disappearance of a distinct proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there was no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery.  The balloon wedge angiograms were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary veins suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery.  Bernstein catheter was advanced into the main pulmonary artery where a wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery.  Angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  Angioplasty of the right pulmonary was then performed using the OptiProbe 6-mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmospheres pressure with disappearance of a distinct waist.  Repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  The proximal right pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted using a PG 2980 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 8-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist.  Distal right upper pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted utilizing a PG 1870 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 7-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter.  Repeat angiograms were then performed.  Attention was then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with a contrast filling of a left-sided azygos vein.  A selective angiogram demonstrated a large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9.4 mm in diameter.  An Amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug was loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein.  Once stable device was confirmed, the device was released from the delivery catheter.  The 4-French Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0.038 inch, 10 cm x 8 mm detachable coils were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein.  A pigtail catheter was then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins, the innominate vein, superior vena cava, the main pulmonary artery, and azygos vein.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation, but was low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79%.  The pulmonary veins were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmHg in 30% oxygen.  Remaining saturations reflected complete admixture.  There was increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave somewhat to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending, descending pressures were similar and normal.  Mean Glenn pressures at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg.  The calculated systemic flow was a normal pulmonary flows reduced with a QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  The pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 4.4 Woods units.  Following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery, there was a slight increase in the Glenn venous pressures to 16 mmHg.  Following embolization of the azygos vein, there was increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84% and increase in mixed venous saturation.  There was similar increase in Glenn pressures to 28 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmHg.  There was an increase in arterial pressure.  The calculated systemic flow increased from 3.1 liters /minute/meter squared to 4.3 liters/minute/meter squared.  Angiogram within the innominate vein following stent implantation demonstrated appropriate stent position without significant distortion of the innominate vein or proximal cava.  There appeared unobstructed contrast flow to the right lower pulmonary artery of a 1-mmHg mean pressure gradient.  There was absence of contrast filling of the right middle and right upper pulmonary artery.  Final angiogram with a contrast injection in the left superior vena cava showed a forward flow through the right Glenn, a good contrast filling of the right lower pulmonary artery, and a widely patent left Glenn negative contrast washout of the proximal right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Contrast injection within the right upper pulmonary artery following the stent implantation demonstrated widely patent proximal right pulmonary artery along the length of the implanted stents though with retrograde contrast flow.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Asplenia syndrome.,2.  Dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava.,3.  Atrioventricular septal defect.,4.  Total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium.,5.  Double outlet right ventricle with malposed great vessels.,6.  Severe pulmonary stenosis.,7.  Separate hepatic venous drainage into the atria.,PRIOR SURGERIES AND INTERVENTIONS:  ,1.  Right modified Blalock-Taussig shunt.,2.  Bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt.,3.  Patch augmentation of the main pulmonary to left pulmonary artery.,CURRENT DIAGNOSES:  ,1.

Embolization of venovenous collateral vessel.,MANAGEMENT: , The case will be discussed in Combined Cardiology Cardiothoracic Surgery case conference.  A repeat catheterization is recommended in 3 months to assess for right pulmonary artery growth and to assess candidacy for Fontan completion.  The patient will be maintained on anticoagulant medications of aspirin and Plavix.  Further cardiology care will be directed by Dr. X."

    "explanation": "The transcription describes a patient who developed cardiac tamponade shortly after removal of epicardial pacing wires. During surgical exploration, bleeding was identified from the right atrial appendix at the site of previous cannulation, which was repaired. This is a well-known complication when epicardial pacing wires are removed, especially if they were attached to the atrium.

The patient was given 1 g of IV Ancef prior to incision.,The left brachiocephalic fistula was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The cephalic vein in the proximal upper arm region appeared to be of adequate caliber.  There was an area of stenosis at the proximal cephalic vein just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The cephalic vein in the proximal forearm region was easily compressible.  The skin overlying the vessel was injected with 1% lidocaine solution.  A small incision was made with the #11 blade.  The cephalic vein then was cannulated with a 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath.  The sheath was advanced over the wire.  A fistulogram was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 French sheath over a 0.025 guide wire.  The sheath was aspirated and flushed with heparinized saline solution.  A 0.025 glidewire was then obtained and advanced, placed over the sheath and across the area of stenosis into the brachial artery.  A 5 French short Kumpe catheter was used to guide the wire into the distal brachial and radial artery.  After crossing the area of stenosis, a 5 x 20 mm standard angioplasty balloon was obtained and prepped from the back table.  This was placed over the glidewire into the area of stenosis and inflated to 14 mmHg pressure and then deflated.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated significant improvement.  However, there is still a remainder of residual stenosis.  The 5-mm balloon was placed over the wire again and a repeat angioplasty was performed.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and a repeat angiogram was performed which demonstrated again an area of stenosis right at the anastomosis.

A 4 x 20 mm cutting balloon was obtained and prepped on the back table.  The 5 French sheath was then exchanged for a 6 French sheath.  The balloon was then placed over the 0.014 guide wire into the area of stenosis and then inflated to normal pressures at 8 mmHg.  The balloon was then deflated and removed over the wire.  A 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was obtained and prepped and placed over the wire into the area of stenosis and inflated to pressures of 14 mmHg.  A repeat fistulogram was performed after the removal of the balloon which demonstrated excellent results with no significant residual stenosis.

Additional topical anesthesia with 2% Xylocaine was applied to the larynx and subsequently throughout the tracheobronchial tree for a total of 18 cc.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea.  The trachea showed mild evidence of erythema and moderate amounts of clear frothy secretions.  These were suctioned clear.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the carina, which was sharp.  Then advanced into the left main stem and each segment, subsegement in the left upper lingula and lower lobe was visualized.  There was mild tracheobronchitis with mild friability throughout.  There was modest amounts of white secretion.  There were no other findings including evidence of mass, anatomic distortions, or hemorrhage.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and advanced into the right mainstem.  Again, each segment and subsegment was well visualized.  The right upper lobe anatomy showed some segmental distortion with dilation and irregularities both at the apical region as well as in the subsegments of the anteroapical and posterior segments.  No specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right.  There was mild tracheal bronchitis with friability.  Upon coughing, there was punctate hemorrhage.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the bronchus intermedius and the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.  These again had no other anatomic lesions identified.  The bronchoscope was then wedged in the right middle lobe and bronchoalveolar samples were obtained.  The bronchoscope was withdrawn and the area was suctioned clear.  The bronchoscope was then advanced into the apical segment of the right upper lobe and the bronchioalveolar lavage again performed.  Samples were taken and the bronchoscope was removed suctioned the area clear.  The bronchoscope was then re-advanced into the right lower lobe and multiple transbronchial biopsies were taken under fluoroscopic guidance in the posterior and lateral segments of the right lower lobe.  Minimal hemorrhage was identified and suctioned clear without difficulty.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the mainstem.  The area was suctioned clear.  Fluoroscopy revealed no evidence of pneumothorax.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without evidence of desaturation or complications."

The patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We first began our dissection by using a #10-blade scalpel to incise the skin over the femoral artery in the groin bilaterally.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the femoral vessels using Bovie electrocautery.  The common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries were encircled and dissected out peripherally.  Vessel loops were placed around the aforementioned arteries.  After doing so, we turned our attention to beginning our abdominal dissection.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline laparotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened and an Omni retractor was positioned.  The aorta was dissected out in the abdomen.  The left femoral vein was identified.  There was a nicely clampable portion of aorta visible.  We, as mentioned, placed our Omni retractor and then turned our attention to performing our anastomosis.  Full-dose heparin was given.  Next, vascular clamps were applied to the iliac vessels as well as to the proximal aorta just below the renal vessels.  A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an arteriotomy in the aorta, which was lengthened both proximally and distally using Potts scissors.  We then beveled our proximal graft and constructed an end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed our graft and noted there was no evidence of a leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We then created our tunnels over the iliac vessels.  We pulled the distal limbs over our ABF graft into the groin.  We then proceeded to perform our right anastomosis first.  We applied vascular clamps on the proximal common femoral, profunda, and superficial femoral arteries.  We incised the common femoral artery and lengthened our arteriotomy in the vessel both proximally and distally.  We then footed the graft down onto the common femoral artery to the level of the SFA and constructed our anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed the common femoral, SFA, and profunda femoris arteries.  We then removed our clamp.  We opened the limb more proximally in the abdomen on the right side.  We then turned our attention to the left side and similarly placed our vascular clamps.

The neck was then extended.  The sutures that were previously in place in the #6 Shiley with proximal extension were removed.  The patient was preoxygenated to 100%.  After several minutes, the patient was noted to have a pulse oximetry of 100%.  The IV tubing that was supporting the patient's trache was then cut.  The tracheostomy tube was then suctioned.,The inner cannula was then removed from the tracheostomy and a nasogastric tube was placed down the lumen of the tracheostomy tube as a guidewire.  The tracheostomy tube was then removed over the nasogastric tube and the operative field was suctioned.  With the guidewire in place and with adequate visualization, a new #6 Shiley with proximal extension was then passed over the nasogastric tube guidewire and carefully inserted into the trachea.  The guidewire was then removed and the inner cannula was then placed into the tracheostomy.  The patient was then reconnected to the ventilator and was noted to have normal tidal volumes.  The patient had a tidal volume of 500 and was returning 500 cc to 510 cc.  The patient continued to saturate well with saturations 99%.  The patient appeared comfortable and her vital signs were stable.  A soft trache collar was then connected to the trachesotomy.  A drain sponge was then inserted underneath the new trache site.  The patient was observed for several minutes and was found to be in no distress and continued to maintain adequate saturations and continued to return normal tidal volumes.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well.  0.25% acetic acid soaks were ordered to the drain sponge every shift."

Selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography.  The patient had a totally occluded right coronary.  We initially started with a JR4 guide.  We were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis.  We were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated.  We then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis, but we had very little guide support, the guide kept coming out.  We then switched to an AL1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion.  We finally had to go an AL2 guide, we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection.  That guided seated, we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis, and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip.  The surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open, but we were able to re-cross with a sport wire.  We then re-dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support, we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm Vision stent, where the lesion was and post-dilated it to 18 atmospheres.  Routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded, whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear, but we were able to re-wire that area and get a 25 x12 Vision balloon and dilate the area and re-establish flow to the small segment.  We then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm Vision stent at 18 atmospheres.  Final angiography showed resolution of the dissection.  We could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent.  No perforation and excellent flow.  During the intervention, we did give a bolus and drip of Angiomax.  At the end of the procedure, we stopped the Angiomax and gave 600 mg of Plavix.

Left anterior descending artery has a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60% stenosis of the LAD before it bifurcates into diagonal.

The rest of the LAD looked good pass the proximal 60% stenosis and after the diagonal branch.  Circumflex artery was nondominant vessel, consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel.  The first obtuse marginal had a long 50% narrowing and then the AV groove branch was free of any disease.  Some mild collaterals to the right were seen.  Right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary, just about 0.5 cm after its origin.  After we got a wire across the area of occlusion, we could see some thrombosis and a 99% stenosis just at the curve.  Following the balloon angioplasty, we established good flow down the distal vessel.  We still had about residual 70% stenosis.

She was not able to have her dialysis as routine.  Her potassium was dramatically elevated at 7 the initial evening of anticipated surgery.  Both Surgery and Anesthesia thought this would be too risky to do.  Thus, she was given medications to decrease her potassium and a temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed in the femoral vein noted for her to have dialysis that night as well as this morning.  This morning her predialysis potassium was 6, and thus she was scheduled for surgery after her dialysis.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A transverse incision was made at the region of the venous anastomosis of the graft.  Further dissection was carried down to the catheter.  The vein appeared to be soft and without thrombus.  This outflow did not appear to be significantly impaired.  A transverse incision was made with a #11 blade on the venous limb of the graft near the anastomosis.  Next, a thrombectomy was done using a #4 Fogarty catheter.  Some of the clot and thrombus was removed from the venous limb.  The balloon did hang up in the multiple places along the venous limb signifying some degree of stenosis.  Once removing most of the clots from the venous limb prior to removing the plug, dilators were passed down the venous limb also indicating the area of stenosis.  At this point, we felt the patient would benefit from a curettage of the venous limb of the graft.  This was done and subsequent passes with the dilator and the balloon were then very easy and smooth following the curettage.  The Fogarty balloon was then passed beyond the clot and the plug.  The plug was visualized and inspected.  This also gave a good brisk bleeding from the graft.  The patient was heparinized and hep saline solution was injected into the venous limb and the angle vascular clamp was applied to the venous limb.  Attention was directed up to its anastomosis and the vein.  Fogarty balloon and thrombectomy was also performed well enough into this way.  There was good venous back bleeding following this.  The area was checked for any stenosis with the dilators and none was present.  Next, a #6-0 Prolene suture was used in a running fashion to close the graft.  Just prior to tying the suture, the graft was allowed to flush to move any debris or air.  The suture was also checked at that point for augmentation, which was good.  The suture was tied down and the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues and a #4-0 undyed Vicryl was used in a running subcuticular fashion to approximate the skin edges.  Steri-Strips were applied and the patient was taken to recovery in stable condition.  She tolerated the procedure well.  She will be discharged from recovery when stable.

The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the fasting state.  The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area.  After achieving appropriate anesthesia, percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was then performed under fluoroscopy.  A guide wire was advanced into the vein.  Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was then administered to the medial aspect of the incision.  A pocket was then fashioned in the medial direction.  Using the previously placed wire, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced over the wire into the left axillary vein.  The dilator was then removed over the wire.  A second wire was then advanced into the sheath into the left axillary vein.  The sheath was then removed over the top of the two wires.  One wire was then pinned to the drape.  Using the remaining wire, a 7 French side-arm sheath was advanced back into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A passive pacing lead was then advanced down into the right atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was then passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in the apical location.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  Suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  With the remaining wire, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced over the wire into the axillary vein.  The wire and dilating sheaths were removed.  An active pacing lead was then advanced down into the right atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  Preformed J stylet was then advanced into the lead.  The lead was positioned in the appendage location.  Lead body was then turned, and the active fix screw was fixed to the tissue.  Adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  Suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  The pocket was then washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  Pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the leads.  The leads were then carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator, and the entire system was placed in the pocket.  The pocket was then closed with 2-0, 3-0, and 4-0 Vicryl using a running mattress stitch.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  No acute complications were noted.,DEVICE DATA,1.  Pulse generator, manufacturer Boston Scientific, model # 12345, serial #1234.,2.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The plan specifically notes a chest x-ray is ordered 'to rule out pneumothorax and verify lead position.' Pneumothorax is a potential complication of axillary vein access, and verifying lead position is important to ensure correct device function. Pacing thresholds are assessed intraoperatively, hematoma is a clinical diagnosis, and confirming patient identity is not the purpose of the x-ray.",

Versed 2.5 mg.,2.  Fentanyl 150 mcg.,3.  Benadryl 50 mg.,CLINICAL HISTORY: , the patient is a pleasant 80-year-old female who presented to the hospital with complete heart block.  She has been referred for a pacemaker implantation.,RISKS AND BENEFITS: , Risks, benefits, and alternatives to implantation of a dual-chamber pacemaker were discussed with the patient.  The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the fasting state.  The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area.  After achieving appropriate anesthesia, percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was then performed under fluoroscopy.  A guide wire was advanced into the vein.  Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was then administered to the medial aspect of the incision.  A pocket was then fashioned in the medial direction.  Using the previously placed wire, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced over the wire into the left axillary vein.  The dilator was then removed over the wire.  A second wire was then advanced into the sheath into the left axillary vein.  The sheath was then removed over the top of the two wires.  One wire was then pinned to the drape.  Using the remaining wire, a 7 French side-arm sheath was advanced back into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A passive pacing lead was then advanced down into the right atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was then passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in the apical location.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  Suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  With the remaining wire, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced over the wire into the axillary vein.  The wire and dilating sheaths were removed.  An active pacing lead was then advanced down into the right atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  Preformed J stylet was then advanced into the lead.  The lead was positioned in the appendage location.  Lead body was then turned, and the active fix screw was fixed to the tissue.  Adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  Suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  The pocket was then washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  Pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the leads.  The leads were then carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator, and the entire system was placed in the pocket.  The pocket was then closed with 2-0, 3-0, and 4-0 Vicryl using a running mattress stitch.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  No acute complications were noted.,DEVICE DATA,1.  Pulse generator, manufacturer Boston Scientific, model # 12345, serial #1234.,2.

He was subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to BiPAP.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to the hospitalist service, treated with frequent small volume nebulizers, treated with IV Solu-Medrol and BiPAP support for COPD exacerbation.  The patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100s to mid 100s.  The patient subsequently received diltiazem, also received p.o. digoxin.  The patient subsequently responded well as well received IV antibiotics including Levaquin and Zosyn.  The patient made slow, but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization.  The patient subsequently was able to be weaned off BiPAP during the day, but continued BiPAP at night and will continue with BiPAP if needed.  The patient may require a sleep study after discharge, but by the third day prior to discharge he was no longer utilizing BiPAP, was simply using supplemental O2 at night and was able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory O2 saturations on one-liter per minute supplemental O2 per nasal cannula.  The patient was able to participate with physical therapy, able to ambulate from his bed to the bathroom, and was able to tolerate a dysphagia 2 diet.  Note that speech therapy did provide a consultation during this hospitalization and his modified barium swallow was thought to be unremarkable and really related only to the patient's severe shortness of breath during meal time.  The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed some mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions that appeared to be unchanged.

However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.

The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.

Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.

      "D. To monitor for recurrence of atrial flutter"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter lasting more than 48 hours, or of unknown duration, anticoagulation is started before cardioversion to reduce the risk of thromboembolism (e.g., stroke) that can occur when normal rhythm is restored and atrial contractions resume. This is why the plan included anticoagulation for four to six weeks before repeating cardioversion. A is incorrect because ventricular remodeling is not the immediate concern. C is incorrect as there is no mention of drug allergy. D is incorrect because anticoagulation is not for monitoring atrial flutter recurrence.",

The patient was rolled into the right lateral decubitus position with the left side up.  All pressure points were padded.  The patient had a sterile DuraPrep preparation to the left chest.  A sterile drape around that was applied.  Also, the patient had Marcaine infused into the incision area.  Following this, the patient had a posterolateral thoracotomy incision, which was a muscle-sparing incision with a posterior approach just over the ausculatory triangle.  The incision was approximately 10 cm in size.  This was created with a 10-blade scalpel.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the subcutaneous tissues.  The auscultatory triangle was opened.  The posterior aspect of the latissimus muscle was divided from the adjacent tissue and retracted anteriorly.  The muscle was not divided.  After the latissimus muscle was retracted anteriorly, the ribs were counted, and the sixth rib was identified.  The superior surface of the sixth rib was incised with Bovie electrocautery and the sixth rib was divided with rib shears.  Following this, the patient had the entire intercostal muscle separated from the superior aspect of the sixth rib on the left as far as the Bovie would reach.  The left lung was allowed to collapse and meticulous inspection of the left lung identified the lesions, which were taken out with stapled wedge resections via a TA30 green load stapler for all of the wedges.

The patient was appropriately prepped and prepared on the table, after which his right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery. Over a standard 0.035 guidewire, coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurements were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery, a 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right coronary artery, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter to measure left ventricular pressure. At the conclusion of the diagnostic study, the case was progressed to percutaneous coronary intervention, which will be described below. Subsequently, right femoral artery angiography was performed which showed right femoral artery which was free of significant atherosclerotic plaque, and an arteriotomy that was suitable for a closure device. Then, a Perclose was used to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, The opening aortic pressure was 91/63. The left ventricular pressure was 94/13 with an end-diastolic pressure of 24. Left ventricular ejection fraction was not assessed, as ventriculogram was not performed. The patient did have some elevated creatinine earlier in this hospital course which warranted limitation of contrast where possible.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery was angiographically okay. The LAD had mild diffuse disease. There appeared to be distal tapering of the LAD. The left circumflex had mild diffuse disease. In the very distal aspect of the circumflex after OM-3 and OM-4 type branch, there was a long, severely diseased segment that appeared to be chronic and subtotal in one area. The runoff from this area appeared to be a very small PLOM type branch and continuation of a circ which did not appear to supply much territory, and there was not much to salvage by approaching this lesion. The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease. The PLV branch was 100% occluded at its ostium at the crux. The PDA at the ostium had an 80% stenosis. The PDA was a fairly sizeable vessel with a long course. The right coronary is dominant.,CONCLUSION:, Mild diffuse coronary artery disease with severe distal left circumflex lesion with not much runoff beyond this lesion. This circumflex appears to be chronically diseased and has areas that appear to be subtotal. There is a 100% PLV branch which is also chronic and reported in his angiogram in the 1990s. There is an ostial 80% right PDA lesion. The plan is to proceed with percutaneous intervention to the right PDA.,The case was then progressed to percutaneous intervention of the right PDA. A 6-French JR4 guide catheter with side holes was selected and used to engage the right coronary artery ostium. The lesion was crossed with a long BMW 0.014 guidewire. Then, we ballooned the lesion with a 2.5 x 9 mm Maverick balloon. Subsequently, we stented the lesion with a 2.5 x 16 mm Taxus drug-eluting stent with a nice angiographic result. The patient tolerated the procedure very well, without complications.,ANGIOPLASTY CONCLUSION:, Successful percutaneous intervention with drug-eluting stent placement to the ostium of the PDA.,RECOMMENDATIONS:, Aspirin indefinitely, and Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily for no less than six months. The patient will be dispositioned back to telemetry for further monitoring.,TOTAL MEDICATIONS DURING PROCEDURE:, Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 25 mcg for conscious sedation. Heparin 8400 units IV was given for anticoagulation. Ancef 1 g IV was given for closure device prophylaxis.,CONTRAST ADMINISTERED:, 200 mL.,FLUOROSCOPY TIME:, 12.4 minutes."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The primary indication for intubation was increased work of breathing and falling saturation despite maximal oxygen delivery (15L nonrebreather). While the pO2 of 66 mmHg is low and suggests hypoxemia, the clinical finding of increased work of breathing and inability to maintain adequate oxygenation is the most important indication for intubation.

    "question": "Which of the following findings on this patient's coronary angiogram is LEAST likely to be amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)?",
    "options": [
      "A. 100% proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery occlusion",
      "B. 80% stenosis at a kink in the small-caliber obtuse marginal (OM) branch (1.5-mm diameter)",
      "C. 40% stenosis in the distal right coronary artery (RCA)",
      "D. 50-60% stenosis in the posterior left ventricular (PLV) branch"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Option B is correct. The report specifically states that the OM branch has an 80% stenosis at a kink in a very small-caliber vessel (1.5-mm). The report notes that this lesion is 'not amenable to percutaneous intervention,' likely due to both the tortuosity (kink) and the small size, increasing the risk of procedural complications and limiting the potential benefit. \n\nOption A (proximal LAD occlusion) is often treated with PCI, especially if there is viable myocardium and suitable anatomy. Option C (40% RCA stenosis) and D (50-60% PLV branch) are not typically treated with PCI, but the question asks which is 'LEAST likely' and the OM lesion is specifically stated as not amenable, making it the best answer.",

She has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort, and has ongoing risks including current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia to name a few. The decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed. She was prepped and prepared on the table; after which, her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. Coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. A 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. Subsequently, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 mL per second for a total of 30 mL. At the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. Did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. As such, an initial attempt to advance a Perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. As such, the Perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system. We then replaced this with a 6-French Angio-Seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. The patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the MAC Unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, Opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. Mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1+. There was normal wall motion in the RAO projection.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. The proximal LAD was 100% occluded. The left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. The obtuse marginal branch which operates as an OM-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. This appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the OM. This is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. The right coronary artery is dominant. The native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. The distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40% stenosis. The posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. The proximal PDA has a 40 to 50% stenosis. The saphenous vein graft to the right PDA is widely patent. There was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The runoff from the PDA is nice with the native proximal PDA and PLV disease as noted above. There is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. The LAD beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. There is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. The saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. Overall, this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004.,CONCLUSION:, 100% proximal LAD mild left circumflex disease with an OM that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. The native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate PLV and PDA disease. The saphenous vein graft to the OM is known to be 100% occluded. The saphenous vein graft to the PDA and the saphenous vein graft to the LAD are open. Normal left ventricular systolic function.,PLAN:, The plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. Aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control.

Bronchoscope was then further advanced into the right upper lobe, which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion.  The mucosa was diffusely friable throughout.  Bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this point, the bronchoscope was then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, it was noted that there was severe mucosal irregularities of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening.  The mucosal area throughout this region was severely friable.  Additional lidocaine was instilled as well as topical epinephrine.  At this time, bronchoscope was maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsies were performed.  At the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps, some resistance was noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible.  So the biopsy forceps was withdrawn and the bronchoscope was completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope was then utilized.  At this time, bronchoscope was then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cords into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty.  At this time, the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, multiple mucosal biopsies were performed with some mild oozing noted.  Several aliquots of normal saline lavage followed.  After completion of multiple biopsies there was good hemostasis.  Cytology flushing was also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquots of additional normal saline lavage was followed.  Bronchoscope was unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the distal trachea.,At this time, bronchoscope was then advanced to the left main stem.  Additional lidocaine was instilled.  The bronchoscope was advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments.  There was no endobronchial lesion visualized.  There is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa was noted throughout.  No endobronchial lesion was visualized in the left bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system.  At this time, bronchoscope was readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquots of normal saline lavage until cleared.  There is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room.  During the bronchoscopy, the patient noted ________ have desaturation and required increasing FiO2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93% to 94%.  The patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedure.,The patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure as well as moderate exertional dyspnea.  This was confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure.  The patient did receive a nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure as well.  The patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above.  The patient was extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptoms.  She was advised regarding smoking cessation.  The patient was also placed on a prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablets starting at 40 mg a day decreasing every three days to continue to wean off.  The patient was also administered Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV x1 in recovery room.  There was no significant bronchospastic component noted, although because of the severity of the mucosal edema, erythema, and her complaints, short course of steroids will be instituted.  The patient was also advised to refrain from using any aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication because of her hemoptysis.  At this time, the patient was also advised that if hemoptysis were to continue or worsen or develop progressive dyspnea, to either contact myself, , or return to ABCD Emergency Room for evaluation of possible admission.  However, the above was reviewed with the patient in great detail as well as with her daughter and mother who were at the bedsite at this time as well."

This was complicated by shunt thrombosis __________ utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  Resulting in significant hypoxic brain injury where he has been left with static encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.  On 04/07/1988, he underwent heart catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  He has been followed conservatively since that time.  A recent echocardiogram demonstrated possibly a significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction with tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity predicting a right ventricular systolic pressure in excess of 180 mmHg.  Right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula was also appreciated.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization to assess hemodynamics associated with his current state of repair.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing on 30% oxygen throughout the case.

She had an echocardiogram today (please see also that report), which shows stable and small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion without tamponade, normal left ventricular ejection fraction at 55% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly dilated right ventricular size, normal right ventricular ejection fraction, moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension, estimated PA systolic pressure of 71 mmHg when compared to the prior echocardiogram done 08/29/07, previously the mitral regurgitation was mild and previously the PA systolic pressure was estimated at 90 mmHg.  Other findings were not significantly changed including pericardial effusion description.  She has a history of longstanding hypertension.  She has been on hemodialysis since 1997 for renal failure, history of mini-strokes documented several years ago, history of seizure disorder, she has a history of right upper extremity edema and right breast enlargement from right subclavian vein occlusion.  She has a history of hypertension, depression, hyperlipidemia, on Sensipar for tertiary hyperparathyroidism.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Includes, cholecystectomy, post fistula in the left arm, which has failed, and right arm, which is being used including number of operative procedures to the fistula.  She follows up with Dr. Y regarding neurovascular surgery.,MEDICATIONS: , On admission:,1.  Norvasc 10 mg once a day.,2.  Aspirin 81 mg once a day.,3.  Colace 200 mg two at bedtime.,4.

Height is 5 feet 1 inch, weight 147 pounds.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who does arouse to voice, but then becomes quite sleepy and apparently that is an improvement from when she was admitted.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins are difficult to assess, but do not appear clinically distended.  No carotid bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  S1, S2 regular rate, 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard with radiation from the left apex towards the left axilla.  No rub, no gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  CVA is benign.  Extremities with no significant edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  She has evidence of right upper extremity edema, which is apparently chronic.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA/LAB DATA: , EKGs are reviewed including from 07/07/09 at 08:31 a.m., which shows atrial fibrillation with left anterior fascicular block, poor R-wave progression when compared to one done on 07/06/09 at 18:25, there is really no significant change.  The atrial fibrillation appears present since at least on EKG done on 11/02/07 and this EKG is not significantly changed from the most recent one.  Echocardiogram results as above.  Chest x-ray shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  BNP shows 3788.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 94, bicarbonate 23, BUN 49, creatinine 5.90.  Troponin was 0.40 followed by 0.34.  INR 1.03 on 05/18/07.  White blood cell count 9.4, hematocrit 42, platelet count 139.,IMPRESSION: , Ms. ABC is a 74-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a fall and she has a history of vascular dementia, so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time.  She does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and I found an EKG report by Dr. X, which shows atrial fibrillation on 08/29/07 per her report.  One of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be a candidate for Coumadin.  Clearly given her history of small mini-strokes, I think Coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation, but the main issue is the fall risk.  If not felt to be significant fall risk then I would strongly recommend Coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year.  I would defer that decision to Dr. Z and Dr. XY who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Fall assessment as per Dr. Z and Dr. XY with possible PT consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk, would put her on Coumadin.  Given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation, she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol.,2.  The patient has elevated BNP and I suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal LV function, I would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis.,3.  Regarding this minimal troponin elevation, I do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small-to-moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what I can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade.  I would defer to her usual cardiologist Dr. X whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification.  I did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08/07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall, but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal LV function seen on that study as well.,4.  Continue Norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol.,5.  The patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary CVA, thromboprophylaxis (albeit understanding that it is inferior to Coumadin).,6.  Continue Dilantin for history of seizures."

Patent ductus arteriosus diminutive left atrium with posterior atrial septal defect with deficient inferior margin.  At completion of the procedure, right ventricular pressure approximating one-half of systemic, normal sinus rhythm, good biventricular function by visual inspection.,PROCEDURE: , After the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  A median sternotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  A subtotal thymectomy was performed.  Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .,I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.  Given the magnitude of the operation, the unavailability of an appropriate level, cardiac surgical resident, Mrs. X (attending pediatric cardiac surgery at the Hospital) participated during the cross-clamp time of the procedure in quality of first assistant."

Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  A median sternotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  A subtotal thymectomy was performed.  Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .,I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.  Given the magnitude of the operation, the unavailability of an appropriate level, cardiac surgical resident, Mrs. X (attending pediatric cardiac surgery at the Hospital) participated during the cross-clamp time of the procedure in quality of first assistant."

He had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved LV function.  He was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries.,FINDINGS DURING THE PROCEDURE:  ,The aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp.  Left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits.  Radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality.  All distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present.  The smallest target was the PDA, which was about 1.5 mm in size.  All the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater.  The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  He was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, Precedex drips.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table.  After he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right IJ triple-lumen catheter and Cordis catheter, right radial A-line, Foley catheter, TEE probes were placed and interfaced appropriately.  The patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest.,After prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed.  Left internal mammary artery was taken down.  Simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques.  Simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques.  Subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure.,Heparin was given.  Pericardium was opened and suspended.  During the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally.  Only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery.,Pericardium was opened and suspended.  Pursestring sutures were placed.  Aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass.  With satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia.  An initial dose of about 1500 mL was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart.,PDA was exposed first.  The right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation.  Even in the PDA, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion.  Arteriotomy on the PDA was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions.  End radial to side PDA anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  This graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and LIMA was accommodated in the slit on its way to the LAD.  LAD was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end LIMA to side LAD anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  LIMA was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle.,Two stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch.  Two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 Prolene.  The patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed.  Following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity.  Temporary V-pacing wires were placed.  Blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum.  Left chest Blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed.  After an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary V-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  With satisfactory hemodynamics, good LV function on TEE and baseline EKG, heparin was reversed using protamine.  Decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation.  Hemostasis was assured.  Mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy Vicryl for musculofascial closure, and Monocryl for subcuticular skin closure.  Dressings were applied.  The patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.  He tolerated the procedure well.  All counts were correct at the termination of the procedure.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes.  Bypass time was 120 minutes.  The patient was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, and Precedex drips."

As an infant, he was initially palliated with the right and modified Blalock-Taussig shunt in October of 2002 and underwent atrioventricular septal defect and repair of pulmonary artery unifocalization and homograft placement between the right ventricle and unifocalized pulmonary arteries.  He developed a significant branch of pulmonary artery stenosis for which on 07/20/2004, he underwent a bilateral balloon pulmonary arterioplasty and stent implantation at the San Diego at Children's Hospital.  This was followed on 09/13/2007 with replacement of pulmonary valve utilizing a 16-mm Contegra valve.  A recent echocardiogram demonstrated a significant branch of pulmonary artery stenosis with the predicted gradient of 41 to 55 mmHg and a well-functioning Contegra valve.

As an infant, he was initially palliated with the right and modified Blalock-Taussig shunt in October of 2002 and underwent atrioventricular septal defect and repair of pulmonary artery unifocalization and homograft placement between the right ventricle and unifocalized pulmonary arteries.  He developed a significant branch of pulmonary artery stenosis for which on 07/20/2004, he underwent a bilateral balloon pulmonary arterioplasty and stent implantation at the San Diego at Children's Hospital.

History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.,5.  Hypertension.,6.  Hepatitis C.,INTERVAL HISTORY: , The patient was recently hospitalized for CHF exacerbation and was discharged with increased medications.  However, he did not fill his prescriptions and came back with persistent shortness of breath on exertion and on rest.  He has history of orthopnea and PND.  He has gained a few pounds of weight but denied to have any palpitation, presyncope, or syncope.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Positive for right upper quadrant pain.  He has occasional nausea, but no vomiting.  His appetite has decreased.  No joint pain, TIA, seizure or syncope.  Other review of systems is unremarkable.,I reviewed his past medical history, past surgical history, and family history.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He has quit smoking, but unfortunately was positive for cocaine during last hospital stay in 01/08.,ALLERGIES: , He has no known drug allergies.,MEDICATIONS:,  I reviewed his medication list in the chart.  He states he is compliant, but he was not taking the revised dose of medications as per discharge orders and prescription.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 91 per minute and regular, blood pressure 151/102 in the right arm and 152/104 in the left arm, weight 172 pounds, which is about 6 pounds more than last visit in 11/07.  HEENT:  Atraumatic and normocephalic.  No pallor, icterus or cyanosis.  NECK:  Supple.  Jugular venous distention 5 cm above the clavicle present.  No thyromegaly.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales or rhonchi.  Pulse ox was 98% on room air.  CVS:  S1 and S2 present.  S3 and S4 present.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  Liver is palpable 5 cm below the right subcostal margin.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing or cyanosis.  A 1+ edema present.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  The patient has hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and branch vessel coronary artery disease.  Clinically, he is in NYHA Class III.  He has some volume overload and was not unfortunately taking Lasix as prescribed.  I have advised him to take Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.  I also increased the dose of hydralazine from 75 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d.  I advised him to continue to take Toprol and lisinopril.  I have also added Aldactone 25 mg p.o. daily for survival advantage.  I reinforced the idea of not using cocaine.  He states that it was a mistake, may be somebody mixed in his drink, but he has not intentionally taken any cocaine.  I encouraged him to find a primary care provider.  He will come for a BMP check in one week.  I asked him to check his blood pressure and weight.  I discussed medication changes and gave him an updated list.  I have asked him to see a gastroenterologist for hepatitis C.  At this point, his Medicaid is pending.  He has no insurance and finds hard to find a primary care provider.  I will see him in one month.  He will have his fasting lipid profile, AST, and ALT checked in one week."

    "question": "Which of the following best describes the method used for myocardial protection during this redo coronary artery bypass grafting procedure?",
    "options": [
      "A. Warm-blood potassium cardioplegia delivered retrograde",
      "B. Cold-blood potassium cardioplegia delivered antegrade",
      "C. Crystalloid cardioplegia delivered retrograde",
      "D. Cold saline topical cooling without cardioplegia"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The operative note specifically states that 'cold-blood potassium cardioplegia, antegrade for myocardial protection' was used. Retrograde delivery was attempted but could not be safely performed, so antegrade administration was used. Warm-blood potassium cardioplegia was only given at one point (for the LAD graft), but the primary method was cold-blood antegrade. Crystalloid cardioplegia and topical saline were not used for myocardial protection in this case.",

The left internal mammary was dissected free from its takeoff at the left subclavian bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The heart was dissected free of its adhesions.  The patient was fully heparinized and cannulated with a single aorta and single venous cannula.  Retrograde cardioplegia cannula was attempted to be placed, but could not be fitted into the coronary sinus safely, therefore, it was banded and oversewn with 5-0 Prolene.  An antegrade cardioplegia needle sump was placed and secured to the ascending aorta.  Cardiopulmonary bypass ensued.  The ascending aorta was cross clamped.  Cold-blood potassium cardioplegia was given antegrade, a total of 10 cc/kg.  It was followed by sumping the ascending aorta.  The obtuse marginal was identified and opened and an end-to-side anastomosis was performed with a running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The vein was cut to length.  Antegrade cardioplegia was given, a total of 200 cc.  The posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery was identified, opened and end-to-side anastomosis then performed with a running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The vein was cut to length.  Antegrade cardioplegia was given.  The mammary was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  The anterior descending was identified, opened and end-to-side anastomosis then performed with running 8-0 Prolene suture and warm blood potassium cardioplegia was given.  The cross clamp was removed.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  Aortotomies were made.  The vein was cut to fit these and sutured in place with running 5-0 Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  All anastomoses were inspected and noted to be patent and dry.  Atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed.  The patient was fully warmed and ventilation was commenced.  The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, ventricular balloon pumping and inotropic support and weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  The patient was decannulated in routine fashion.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A single mediastinal chest tube and bilateral pleural Blake drains were placed.  The sternum was closed with figure-of-eight stainless steel wire.  The linea alba was closed with figure-of-eight of #1 Vicryl, the sternal fascia closed with running #1 Vicryl, the subcu closed with running 2-0 Dexon, skin with running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.

    "question": "What is the primary reason a right femoral intraaortic balloon pump was placed in this patient during the operation?",
    "options": [
      "A. To facilitate harvesting of the saphenous vein",

Next, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula.  Dissection was carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery.  The 5th rib was counted, and the 6th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We identified the major fissure.  We then began by freeing up the inferior pulmonary ligament, which was done with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, we used Bovie electrocautery to dissect the pleura off the lung.  The pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung were identified.  Of note was the fact that there was a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable.  As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection was used to identify the pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung.  Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This was done with suture ligature in combination with clips.  After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk.  It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.  It was then divided.  Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus.  Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus.  The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel.  The specimen was handed off.  We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessels to the lymph nodes.  We inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There was minimal bleeding.  We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube.  The rib space was closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, was placed in the subcutaneous flap.  The muscle layer was closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The transesophageal echocardiogram identified an intracardiac thrombus at the base of the left atrial appendage. In patients with atrial fibrillation, thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage is a well-known source of cardioembolic stroke, which fits with the patient's history of right MCA CVA. Mild mitral regurgitation and trace aortic insufficiency are common, often clinically insignificant, and unlikely to cause embolic stroke. Mild nonmobile aortic atherosclerosis could be a source of emboli, but the presence of a definite thrombus in the left atrial appendage is a more likely etiology in this context.",

    "question": "According to the findings, which of the following best describes the patient's aortic valve?",
    "options": [
      "A. Normal valve with no abnormalities",
      "B. Sclerotic with mild-to-moderate aortic insufficiency",
      "C. Severely stenotic with severe regurgitation",
      "D. Calcified with significant leaflet restriction"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The report states the aortic valve is sclerotic without significant restriction of leaflet motion and that the patient has mild-to-moderate aortic insufficiency. There is no mention of severe stenosis, severe regurgitation, or significant leaflet restriction. Therefore, option B accurately describes the findings.",

    "description": " Transesophageal echocardiogram and direct current cardioversion.",
    "transcription": "EXAM: , Transesophageal echocardiogram and direct current cardioversion.,REASON FOR EXAM:  ,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.,2.  Shortness of breath.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was then sedated using a total of 4 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl.  Following this, transesophageal probe was placed in the esophagus.  Transesophageal views of the heart were then obtained.,FINDINGS:,1.  Left ventricle is of normal size.  Overall LV systolic function is preserved.  Estimated ejection fraction is 60% to 65%.  No wall motion abnormalities are noted.,2.  Left atrium is dilated.,3.  Left atrial appendage is free of clots.,4.  Right atrium is of normal size.,5.  Right ventricle is of normal size.,6.  Mitral valve shows evidence of mild MAC.,7.  Aortic valve is sclerotic without significant restriction of leaflet motion.,8.  Tricuspid valve appears normal.,9.  Pulmonic valve appears normal.,10.  Pacer wires are noted in the right atrium and in the right ventricle.,11.  Doppler interrogation of moderate mitral regurgitation is present.,12.  Mild-to-moderate AI is seen.,13.  No significant TR is noted.,14.  No significant TI is noted.,15.  No pericardial disease seen.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Preserved left ventricular systolic function.,2.  Dilated left atrium.,3.  Moderate mitral regurgitation.,4.  Aortic valve sclerosis with mild-to-moderate aortic insufficiency.,5.  Left atrial appendage is free of clots.,Following these, direct current cardioversion was performed.  Three biphasic shock waves of 150 and two of 200 joules were then applied to the patient's chest in anteroposterior direction without success in conversion to sinus rhythm.  The patient remained in atrial fibrillation.,PLAN: , Plan will be to continue medical therapy.  We will consider using beta-blocker, calcium channel blockers for better ventricular rate control."
